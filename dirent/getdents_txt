The following documents the getdents() call which is *not* part of the
QDOS DIRENT package --- I include this only for interest.

GETDENTS(2) Standard Extension

NAME

	getdents - get directory entries in a file system independent
	           format

SYNOPSIS

	#include <sys/types.h>
	#include <sys/dirent.h>
	
	int getdents (fildes, buf, nbyte)
	int fildes;
	char *buf;
	unsigned nbyte;

DESCRIPTION

Fildes is a file descriptor obtained from an open (2) or dup (2) system
call.

Getdents attempts to read nbyte bytes from the directory associated with
fildes and to format them as file system independent entries in the
buffer pointed to by buf . Since the file system independent directory
entries are of variable length, in most cases the actual number of bytes
returned will be less than nbyte .

The file system independent directory entry is specified by the dirent
structure. For a description of this see dirent (4).

On devices capable of seeking, getdents starts at a position in the file
given by the file pointer associated with fildes . Upon return from
getdents , the file pointer has been incremented to point to the next
directory entry.

This system call was developed in order to implement the readdir routine
[for a description see directory (3C)] and should not be used for other
purposes.

SEE ALSO

	directory(3C), dirent(4).

DIAGNOSTICS

Upon successful completion a non-negative integer is returned indicating
the number of bytes of buf actually filled. (This need not be the number
actually used in the actual directory file.)

A value of zero indicates the end of the directory has been reached. If
getdents fails for any other reason, a value of -1 is returned and the
external integer variable errno is set to indicate the error.

WARNINGS

Entries for "." and ".." may not be reported for some file system types.

The exact set of errno values and meanings may vary among
implementations.
