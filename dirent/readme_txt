'DIRENT' routines
=================

Many Unix systems include the headers <dirent.h> and <sys/dirent.h>
which declare structures and functions for reading directories in a
fairly portable way. The precise definitions of these types and
functions are the subject of an IEEE standard.

A public domain implementation of these routines was written by a
Douglas Gwyn and I have used his work as a model for a set of routines
providing the same service under QDOS. The header files are essentially
modified versions of his; the source files, however, are all my own
work.

Gwyn's routines differ slightly from the Posix standard; I have followed
his version, since the difference is fairly trivial.

For further information, see dirent_txt and directory_txt which describe
the data structures and functions.
