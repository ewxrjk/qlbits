QL Bits
=======

Ancient QL-related stuff I did long ago. I make no promises about the
contents whatsoever l-)

What's here:

- [Alien Disks](aliendisks) - programs for accessing various disk formats (BASIC)
- [Archiver](archiver) - compression/decompression program
- [dirent.h](dirent) - opendir &c for QDOS
- [Library Management](libman) - SROFF object code library management tools
- [Linker](lnk) - SROFF linker
- [Make](make) - 'make' implementation
- [Nul device](nulldev) - NUL device (68K asm)
- [Othello](othello) - Othello game
- [CA](rjk_ca) - cellular automaton
- [Hbutils](hbutils) - Hotkey and button utilities (68k asm)

All are in C unless specified otherwise (specifically they were
written for the [C68](http://www.dilwyn.me.uk/c/) compiler). See the
individual directies for more detailed descriptions and licences.
