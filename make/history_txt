                         MAKE Revision History

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This revision history is listed with the most recent version first.

Version 2.1 29/6/1993, 30/6/1993, 28/7/1993

-	Redesigned the make algorithm. See appendix B for details.
	This involves changes to many parts of the program.

-	Improved command line handling. Changed some of the options so
	that they are more like Unix Make (though differences remain.)

-	Added Bison and Flex templates. They're parameterised enough to
	work with equivalent programs?

-	Modified analyse_c so that we use a big array to check whether a
	character is allowed to be part of a filename.

-	Cosmetic changes to the manual.

-	Lines from the input may now be any length before and after
	macro-expansion. Guess what, I only got around to this after a
	Makefile I use expanded some macros to line longer than the
	buffer size at the time and gave bizarre results.

-	Modified decide() and the part of main() that calls decide() to
	ensure that remakes are picked up correctly: if a target has a
	dependent target which is to be remade, then the target itself
	should be remade. Multiple targets on the command line may
	require several passes.

-	Minor hacks on command line definition of macros.

Version 2.02, 2.02a 20/6/1993, 26/6/1993, 27/6/1993

-	Don't try and execute directories: much hacking of system_c.

-	Altered what characters MAKE thinks filenames are made up of.
	They are now any non-space character apart from ':', '=' or '-'.
	This is the kind of thing I may mess around with in later
	versions.

-	Changed the manual a bit

-	If you use -n, then all commands are listed even if they are
	marked as 'quiet' with the '@' prefix.

-	Changed some of the standard macros to be more like other Make
	programs. That should break quite a few people's Make files
	(most of mine...)

-	Took memory functions out of -ltools into memory_c.

Version 2.01 6/4/1993, 11/4/1993

2.0 was full of bugs:

-	Removed the bug in the analyse_c inputcommands() function that
	means only the last command in a sequence of commands attached
	to a rule or template is recognised.

	(Rather irritating. I'd discovered this shortly after sending
	out three copies...)

-	Removed a further bug here relating to 'quiet' and 'ignore'
	modes.

-	Updated the _x_o template to preprocess assembler source. This
	template uses a temporary file on $(TMP) to keep the
	intermediate file which will not be deleted if an error stops
	the make. But, it will get overwritten and then deleted when you
	removed the bugs from your source.

	The handler for this should really be in CC, but the version I
	have doesn't get it quite right. Maybe fixed now?

-	If you had (say) two _x_o targets then things went horribly
	wrong because the first one would create the _x target, and
	then decide it wasn't worth using; the second one would find
	it already created and therefore assume that it was good to use:
	disaster. Fixed.

-	Added automake (-x) feature. Any use to anyone?

Version 2.0 28/3/1993, 29/3/1993, 31/3/1993

A major rewrite:

-	Removed the line splitting feature. You can no longer choose
	which characters to use for comments etc (was silly) and the
	quiet/ignore error characters have swapped around to give more
	standard usage. (Oops!)

-	You can now specify multiple targets in one rule.

-	Ql Make is now easier to port to other systems than the Ql
	thanks to the #defines in make_h. To reduce unnecessary re-makes
	I split some of make_h into types_h, and some of main_c into
	globals_c.

	system_c is still very Ql-dependent.

-	Language dependent strings are now in a separate file. Just
	alter the makefile and do a make to change language. Currently
	only English supported.

-	Got quiet and ignore stuff done properly this time.

-	$$ now becomes $ like it's meant to.

-	Other minor changes arising from re-write. For example, the
	source occupies several more files which leads to a greater
	degree of modularity. Updated manual.

-	Turned this update list upside down. I think the most recent
	changes are probably what you want to see first!

-	Got rid of my old copyright message and replaced it with the one
	suggested by FSF. N.B., there is a GNU Make program which is
	nothing to do with this one. (It's rather big.)

Version 1.21 27/3/1993

-	Tidied up analyse_c to be more flexible about macro names and
	filenames and to reduce code duplication.

-	Accidentally deleted source... Retrieved some by trawling slave
	blocks (boring!). Tried to use a disk recovery program to get
	some more back but went and unzipped it onto the disk I was
	trying to recover from. Thus overwriting all the stuff I was
	hoping to recover.

	I'll rewrite it and call it version 2.

	Today wasn't all bad, Cambridge won the boat race :-)

Version 1.2 19/3/1993

-	Changed treatment of templates to remove bugs relating to chains
	of template driven makes.

-	Added stuff to deal with secondary outputs and multiple

-	Altered expandmacros() to cope with stuff relating to multiple
	dependent lists.

-	Macros no longer required brackets even if their names are many
	characters long, though brackets may be required to eliminate
	ambiguity. Ambiguity to humans, that is. :-)

-	Renamed what I previously called rules as templates so that I
	can call 'normal' things rules! Unix Make calls them "inference
	rules" which is quite sensible.

-	Piles of other changes, small and large. Sorry I haven't listed
	them.

Version 1.11 20/7/1992

-	Removed bug relating to ignoring of errors. Removed automatic
	wildcard vector; such a feature is inappropriate to a make
	program.

Version 1.1 17/7/1992

-	Adapted to use ANSI style function prototypes.

-	Took advantage of C68 3.01 features such as automatic wildcard
	expansion and tidier window.

Version 1.01 14/3/1992

-	Removed a feature which turned out to be less useful than I
	thought. (By mid-1993 can't even remember what it was...)

Version 1.0 19/1/1992
