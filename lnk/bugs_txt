LNK bug list
============

Some of these are not so much bugs as differences from other linkers, or
the absence of a feature that seemed to trivial to be worth coding for.
You will mostly find these do not cause problems.

Bugs marked with [F] will probably get fixed; those marked with [N] will
never get fixed. I haven't decided about those marked [?].

o	The precise set of c68 and lnk options which can be applied to
	cc and xcc is rather badly documented. [F]

o	XREFs which should get overwritten due to backwards OFFSET aren't
	(not always, anyway.) [N]

o	Report of undefined symbols not sorted. [N]

o	Some SROFF errors cause immediate termination of the link; most
	just cause the file being worked on to be abandoned. See load_c
	for explanations --- search for exit . [?]

o	Libraries must be sorted in a specific order to resolve
	reference chains. [N]
	The same applies to LD and GST Linker.

o	ORG directive not supported. [N]

o	UNPROTO is not supported by CC. [N]

o	Only 'COMMON DUMMY' is supported. [F]

Since this is a fairly early version, I've left various assertions
active in the code. If you get an 'assertion failed' message then you've
probably found a bug; it may be possible to construct a SROFF that
contains sufficient errors to make LNK fail an assertion but you should
get a 'fatal error' message first.

The following bugs apply to version 1.0 only:

o	The contents of 'gaps' is genuinely undefined. This is permitted
	by the SROFF definition but isn't very convenient. [F]

All newly discovered bugs should be reported to:
